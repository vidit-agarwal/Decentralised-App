# Decentralised-App
Decentralised App 

# Demo 
 > We will build a decentralised voting app . No need to trust anyone  , Tallied votes will not be going to be modified 
 
# But first , what happened to web 
The web started off as 'decentralised' . Everyone who wanted a website bought their own server and hosted the website on it 
But after the DOT-COM Bubble , data started to become centralised 

# This is bad , Real Bad :
It's shrinking the economy
Too much concentrated power
We have no say in how our data is used
We should get paid for our data

Decentralised App 

# Demo 
 > We will build a decentralised voting app . No need to trust anyone  , Tallied votes will not be going to be modified 
 
# But first , what happened to web 
The web started off as 'decentralised' . Everyone who wanted a website bought their own server and hosted the website on it 
But after the DOT-COM Bubble , data started to become centralised 

# This is bad , Real Bad :
It's shrinking the economy
Too much concentrated power
We have no say in how our data is used
We should get paid for our data

> Decentralised systems are those where no node is telling any other node what to do .Bitcoin is both distributed because it's timestamped public ledger , the blockchain ,resides on multiple computer and decentralised because if one node goes down the network is still able to operate
    .) Multiple servers
    .) Demand and failure better handled
Examples : Bitcoin & Ethereum
